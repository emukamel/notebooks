      "Activity-Dependent mRNA Transport:\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "* **Question**: If we have a desired distribution of mRNA along a dendrite, how can we tune local trafficking rates to produce this goal?\n",
      "    * Answer: [in this notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/blob/master/code_pubs/2014_11_04/trafficking.ipynb)\n",
      "* **Related Question**: If we observe a particular distribution of mRNA along a dendrite, can we infer what the local trafficking rates are?\n",
      "    * Depends on whether the mRNA or protein distribution is at steady-state\n",
      "    * Can't we directly measure trafficking experimentally?\n",
      "    * Other problem \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) rate constants could just go to zero to keep everything at steady-state\n",
      "* **Experimental Question**: Is the trafficking of *Arc* to the dendrites dependent on calcium? What happens if we use a calcium chelator? Is it mis-trafficked? What if we knockout CaMKII?\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-compartment homeostatic models:\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "* The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of modeling activity-dependent homeostatic regulation in a cable of connected compartments.\n",
      "    * I can write all the code in julia very easily. Don't need to rely on NEURON.\n",
      "    * The results will probably extend. The branch points add some further complexity, but nothing too crazy\n",
      "* Things that that can be addressed in this simple model:\n",
      "    * Interactions between LTP and synaptic scaling\n",
      "    * How to homeostatically maintain back-propagating action potentials\n",
